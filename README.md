    2. Create a model/entity to store zip codes in the database.
    3. Create a zip code repository.

    5. Any time the getForecast method is called in the weather service, add the zip code to the database.
    6. Create a weather service method to get the (up to 10) most recent searches.
    7. In both of the weather controller methods, call the new service method and add the the list of zip codes to the model.
